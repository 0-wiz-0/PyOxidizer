# apple-bundle

`apple-bundle` is a library crate implementing functionality related
to Apple *bundles*, a foundational primitive in Apple operating systems for
encapsulating code and resources. (The ``.app`` *directories* in
``/Applications`` are *application bundles*, for example.)

`apple-bundle` is part of the
[PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git) project and this
crate is developed in that repository.

While this crate is developed as part of a larger project, modifications
to support its use outside of its primary use case are very much welcome!
