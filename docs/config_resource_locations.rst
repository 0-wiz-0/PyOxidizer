=============================
Specifying Resource Locations
=============================

Various functionality relates to the concept of a *resource location*, or
where a resource should be loaded from at run-time. See
:ref:`packaging_resources` for more.

Resource locations are represented as strings in Starlark. The mapping
of strings to resource locations is as follows:

``default``
   Use the default resource location. Often equivalent to a resource location
   of the type/value ``None``.

``in-memory``
   Load the resource from memory.

``filesystem-relative:<prefix>``
   Install and load the resource from a filesystem relative path to the
   build binary. e.g. ``filesystem-relative:lib`` will place resources
   in the ``lib/`` directory next to the build binary.
