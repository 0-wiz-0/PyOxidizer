# debian-repo-tool

`debian-repo-tool` is a binary crate providing the `drt` command-line
executable. This CLI tool allows interacting with Debian repositories
(published entities that define `.deb` packages and other metadata).

# Project Relationship

`debian-repo-tools` is part of the
[PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git) project and
this crate is developed in that repository.

While this crate is developed as part of a larger project, modifications
to support its use outside of its primary use case are very much welcomed
and encouraged!
