# python-packaging-net

This crate provides functionality related to Python packaging which requires
network access.

`python-packaging-net` is part of the
[PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git) project and
this crate is developed in that repository.

While this crate is developed as part of a larger project, modifications
to support its use outside of its primary use case are very much welcome!
