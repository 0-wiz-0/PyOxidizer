Shipping Applications with ``tugger``
=====================================

The Tugger project aims to make it easy to ship applications.

Tugger is a Rust crate containing code related to application distribution.
Tugger defines a Starlark dialect so Starlark configuration files can be
used to script the generation of distributable artifacts.

Tugger is part of the PyOxidizer Project and is developed inside the
PyOxidizer repository at https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer. However,
Tugger is designed to be a standalone project and doesn't require PyOxidizer.
