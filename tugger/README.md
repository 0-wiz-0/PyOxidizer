# Tugger

Tugger is a generic application packaging and distribution tool.

Tugger provides its core functionality as a Rust crate (`tugger`). This
functionality is exposed through a Starlark dialect.

Tugger is part of the
[PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git) project. However,
Tugger is intended to be useful as a standalone project.

## Status

Tugger is still very alpha and rough around the edges. You probably don't
want to use this crate.
